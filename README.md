2. Personal research (environ 20-25 pages)
●	Introduction (environ 1-1½ pages)
o	Aim of the study: evaluation of 3 biological markers in children with bronchial asthma --> serum vitamin D level, number of eosinophils and enzymatic activity of chitotriosidase
o	 General information on the role of vitamin D in inflammation
o	 General information on the importance of the number of eosinophils in allergic diseases
o	 Importance of the study: evaluation of chitotriosidase as a potential marker of the inflammatory response in bronchial asthma, compared to two other markers already established (serum level of vitamin D, number of eosinophils) --> search for a possible link between the enzymatic activity of chitotriosidase and the clinical manifestations
o	Objectives
▪	 Search for any statistically significant differences between the values of the vitamin D markers and the number of eosinophils and the clinical manifestations (presence of atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis, level of asthma control)
▪	 Search for any statistically significant differences between circulating chitotriosidase values and clinical manifestations (presence of atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis, level of asthma control)

●	Patients and methods
o	Type of study: cross-sectional, for the evaluation of a biological marker
o	 Site of progress: Department of Medical Biochemistry, UMF Cluj-Napoca
o	Patients: 131 children with bronchial asthma, informed consent of parents
o	 Clinical data collected from files, Clinic of Pediatrics III, UMF Cluj-Napoca
o	 Experimental methods: assay of serum chitotriosidase, expression in nmol/mL/h
o	Statistical analysis methods: calculation of the average of the values, statistical comparison by the Student test or ANOVA.

●	Results
1.	Description of patients
-	Patient characteristics: table with the number of patients by age group, number of patients with atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis, distribution of patients according to level of asthma control

2.	Evaluation of vitamin D markers and eosinophil count
-	Comparison between the average values of vitamin D and the number of eosinophils according to the presence of atopic dermatitis (Student test)
-	Comparison between the average values of vitamin D and the number of eosinophils according to the presence of allergic rhinitis (Student test)
-	Comparison between the average values of vitamin D and the number of eosinophils according to the level of asthma control (ANOVA test)
  
3.	Evaluation of chitotriosidase as a biomarker of the inflammatory syndrome
-	Comparison between the average values of chitotriosidase according to the presence of atopic dermatitis (Student test)
-	Comparison between the average values of chitotriosidase according to the presence of allergic rhinitis (Student test)
-	Comparison between the average values of chitotriosidase according to the level of asthma control (ANOVA test)
●	Discussions (plusieurs pages)
o	Review of the objectives stated in the introduction and analysis of each result: what is the importance of the statistically significant/non-significant results
o	Interpretation and search for an explanation for each result
o	Comparison of results with other similar studies already published
o	Limitations of the study
o	Prospects for further research

Conclusions (1/2-1 page): listing of the main results.
